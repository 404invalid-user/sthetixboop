__**a full list of commands and what they do**__

You can join the server to use then here http://discord.link/sthetix

__commands that can be used by all members:__

- [ping] - pings the bots latency in (ms) miller seconds. 
- [rules] [rule] - sends an embed of the selected rule if the specified rule number doesn't exist it will send an error rule doesn't exist embed.
- [help] - sends an embed of all the commands. to get help with a specific command you can do /help (command)
- [sthetix] - sends a link to sthetix youtube, discord server, twitter, Facebook and Instagram. 
- [about] - sends an embed of basic info on the bot.
- [sd-lock] - sends an embed of what a locked sd card looks like and an unlocked sd card looks like.
- [sd-root] - sends an embed of where your sd card's root it and what it should look like.


__**commands that only can be used by admins and staff:**__

- [say] - gets the bot to repeat what you said after /say
- [embed] - lets staff and admins make a custom embed for the bot to send.

command layout:
/embed [title] [description] [colour]

__an example would be:__
>  /embed [a cool title] [this is the description] [##12f100]

the [] are required around the title description and colour code because it tells the bot where the title, description and colour code start and end.


__**commands that can only be used by admins:**__

- [rules-info] - sends an embed with all the rules links and info to the rules and info channel.
- [console-roles] - sends an embed with the commands to get the roles to the console-roles channel.
- [old rules-info] - sends the old rules and info text to the rules and info channel (not an embed message)
- [stat] - allows you to set the status of the bot so if you do '/stat watching the sthetix official discord server' the bot will show the status 'playing watching the sthetix official discord server'
